.. attention::

   This is a work-in-progress. The first stable release of Algoneer and Algonaut
   is planned for August 30, until then both the documentation and the code
   itself is prone to change dramatically. We encourage feedback and comments
   and welcome you to try Algoneer, please be aware that it's not a stable
   tool yet though.
